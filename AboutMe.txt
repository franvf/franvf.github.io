Hi! It is Fran Vañó, and my passion is all related to blockchain technology like NFTS, web3 projects, smart contracts, etc. Here I have some projects I did for learning and gaining experience. 
I started learning about blockchain at the end of 2021 because I was listening to some friends talk about blockchain, Ethereum and smart contracts, but I had no idea about what these technologies were and how they worked. From that moment, I started reading some articles and looking for information about blockchain. 
As a computer engineer, I have some programming skills, so I quickly understood the smart contracts programmed with Solidity and how the blockchain structure is built. This made that I was more and more interested. Currently, I'm working on an NFTS company and investing my free time in taking some courses and studying the blockchain world.

And now something about me: I'm an extrovert and can work with a team or individually. I have good skills in communication and leadership. I love to read and train in my free time.
