Hi! My name is Fran Vañó, and machine learning, data science, data analysis, AI, are my passion. I have some projects that I have for learn and get experience, and are uploaded
I was started to learn about data science in summer of 2020 because I was listening to some people talk about artificial intelligence and machine learning but I had no 
idea about what these technologies was and how it works, so, I started to read some articles and looking for information about what ML was. As a computer engineering student
I have some programming skills, so I quickly understood the code used to make simple predictions and manage the data, this made my interest about ML grow. Later I discovered the 
data science, data analysis, business intelligence, etc., and for this reason now I use my free time to take some curses and study the AI world. 

One of my values is the health, so I'm interested in applying this technology to the healthcare and all related fields. My mission is to help hospitals and clinics to detect 
easily and more accurate the diseases.  Also, I like to use the ML to make some sports analysis about soccer or other sports. 

I'm extrovert and I can work with a team or individually. I have good skills for communication and leadership. I love read and train in my free time.
